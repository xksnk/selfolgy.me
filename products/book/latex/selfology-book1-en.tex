\vspace{2em}

This book is not a test or questionnaire. It's a space for meeting yourself.

There are no right or wrong answers here. Only yours---honest, real, alive.

\vspace{1.5em}
{\sffamily\bfseries How This Book Works}

You'll encounter three levels of questions:

\textbf{Surface} --- light questions to warm up. They help you tune in and connect with yourself.

\textbf{Exploration} --- deeper questions. This is where the real work begins. It may feel uncomfortable---that's normal.

\textbf{Depth} --- the most important questions. They require strength, time, and a safe space.

\vspace{1.5em}
{\sffamily\bfseries The Aquarium Metaphor}

Imagine your mind as an aquarium.

At the top---crystal clear water. There you can see your thoughts, desires, and decisions clearly. But this part makes up only 10--20\%. This is your conscious mind.

The remaining 80--90\% is murky water at the bottom. It's hard to see anything there. This is your subconscious---the place where the real reasons for your decisions, fears, and desires live.

This book is like a sieve. You'll bring up thoughts and feelings from the bottom that usually remain invisible.

{\sffamily\bfseries How to Proceed}

\textbf{Create space.} Choose a time when no one will disturb you.

\textbf{Tune in.} Pour yourself your favorite drink. Get comfortable. Give yourself permission to be honest.

\textbf{Write by hand.} When you write by hand, your brain processes information more deeply.

\textbf{Don't rush.} Give yourself as much time as you need. One question might take a minute, or half an hour.

\vspace{1.5em}
{\sffamily\bfseries Safety Guidelines}

You'll need energy for this journey.

Don't try to complete everything in one sitting. Move at your own pace. Take breaks.

If a question triggers strong emotions---that's a sign you've touched something important. Approach it gently.
