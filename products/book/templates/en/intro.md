# Welcome

This book is not a test or questionnaire. It's a space for meeting yourself.

There are no right or wrong answers here. Only yours—honest, real, alive.

## How This Book Works

You'll encounter three levels of questions:

**SURFACE** — light questions to warm up. They help you tune in and connect with yourself.

**EXPLORATION** — deeper questions. This is where the real work begins. It may feel uncomfortable—that's normal.

**DEPTH** — the most important questions. They require strength, time, and a safe space.

## The Aquarium Metaphor

Imagine your mind as an aquarium.

At the top—crystal clear water. There you can see your thoughts, desires, and decisions clearly. But this part makes up only 10–20%. This is your conscious mind.

The remaining 80–90% is murky water at the bottom. It's hard to see anything there. This is your subconscious—the place where the real reasons for your decisions, fears, and desires live.

This book is like a sieve. You'll bring up thoughts and feelings from the bottom that usually remain invisible. Moving them up into consciousness. This way you'll increase the percentage of "clear water" and find valuable treasures in the depths.

You won't have to wait for life to create a storm and have something float up on its own.

## How to Proceed

**Create space.** Choose a time when no one will disturb you. This can't be done between tasks on the subway or during lunch.

**Tune in.** Pour yourself your favorite drink. Get comfortable. Give yourself permission to be honest.

**Write by hand.** It's best to work with a notebook. When you write by hand, your brain processes information more deeply. Plus, you can always return to your notes.

**Don't rush.** Each question has a recommended time. But it's just a guideline. If a question resonates—stay with it longer. If it's not flowing today—set it aside and return later.

## Safety Guidelines

You'll need energy for this journey.

Don't try to complete everything in one sitting. Move at your own pace. Take breaks—as many as you need.

Your depth of exploration depends on your state. When tired or anxious, you'll just "dip your toes." And that's okay too.

If a question triggers strong emotions—that's a sign you've touched something important. Approach it gently.
