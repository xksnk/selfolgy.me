**Attention: Deep Work Ahead**

The following section requires special care.

Before continuing, make sure:
- You are in a safe place
- You have time and energy
- No one will disturb you

These questions may evoke strong emotions. That's normal—it means you're touching something important.

If it becomes too overwhelming—stop. Take a break. Return later.

Be gentle with yourself.
